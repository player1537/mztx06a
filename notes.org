   Interfacing MZTX06A 2.2" TFT Screen on Raspberry Pi

   I recently bought a 2.2" TFT screen with SPI interface and 320x240
   pixel resolution on Deal Extreme.  According to the very
   rudimentary documentation it needs to be connected like this :

   | lcd pin | lcd names | Rpi pin | Rpi name |
   |---------+-----------+---------+----------|
   |       1 | LED+      |       1 | 3.3V     |
   |       2 | VDD-      |      17 | 3.3V     |
   |       3 | /RST-     |      22 | GPIO25   |
   |       4 | RS-       |      21 | MISO     |
   |       5 | /CS-      |      26 |          |
   |       6 | SCI-      |      19 | MOSI     |
   |       7 | SCL-      |      23 | SCLK     |
   |       8 | GND       |      25 | GND      |

   After getting the MZTX06A software from github :

   https://github.com/yaolet/mztx06a.git

   and launching the makefile, the resulting MZTX06A executable
   copies the /dev/fb content to the screen. Here below the result
   when launched directly from rc.local ...

   In order to match framebuffer and screen resolution, one has to
   modify /boot/config.txt and uncomment the lines with Horizontal
   and vertical screen resolution. Please use 320 and 240 in order to
   avoid blurred screens.

   This method works flawlessly with X. Just startx and
   watch. Unfortunately 320x240 pixels doesn't leave much space for
   actual work. Most user interfaces are not suited for low-res.

   Not in English, so I probably won't be able to make much use of any
   of their resources.

   MZTX06A 2.2 Inch IPS TFT LCD Display Module For Raspberry Pi

   Description:

   Compatible with Raspberry Pi, offering wide viewing angle, high
   brightness, high contrast; Allows you view from any angles, which
   is close to 180 degrees; *The SPI core dedicated adapter is
   self-designed timing chip SPI clock generation products available*
   *to 33MHz* , much faster than the other driver chip screen.

   Connection:

   - 8 LED + (common anode LED backlight);
   - 7 VDD (+3.3 V Supply);
   - 6 / RST (reset pin can be directly connected to +3.3 V provincial IO)S;
   - 5 RS (command / data indication feet);
   - 4 / CS (chip select pin can be directly connected to GND province IO);
   - 3 SCI (serial data pin, which is the SPI MOSI);
   - 2 SCL (serial clock pin, which is SCK);
   - 1 GND (ground)

   Feature:

   - Size: 2.2 inches (5.6cm diagonal);
   - Color: 65K colors;
   - Resolution: QVGA 320 x 240;
   - Interface: SIP, 8-pin 2.54mm single row

   *Note: Probably not an SIP interface, but instead SPI*

   Tontec 2.4-inch TFT LCD 240x320 RGB Pixels Touch Screen Display
   Monitor For Raspberry Pi

   This Raspberry Pi Screen is designed for raspberry pi tailored a
   expansion board, set LCD, touch, IO expansion, RTC functions in
   one, greatly enriched the raspberry pie can learn playability.

   "Display Part" use *Hitachi's IPS technology company of the LCD*,
   the screen viewing angle is large, close to 180 degrees; very high
   brightness and contrast, color of the screen is 8,16 I80 parallel,
   in order to save resources and high-speed IO the transmission of
   data, *the owner after two months of struggle with CPLD design a
   SPI-I80 parallel converter*, the measured SPI clock can reach 120M.

   "Touch Part" adopts TI (Texas Instruments) company TSC2003 chip,
   the chip I2C Interface 4-wire resistive controller, also with a
   2-way BAT and AIN, can monitor 2-way 2-way voltage and other
   signals.

   "IO extension Part" using *NS (National Semiconductor)'s LP3943
   the I2C interface chip 16 IO expansion*, which with the PWM circuit
   can drive the LED.

   "RTC real time clock" using NXP's PCF8563, the chip I2C interface,
   with a calendar. (This section is optional, standard shipping is
   blank, the customer can DIY)

   - Size: 2.4 inches

   In this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of installing
   an LCD touchscreen on the Raspberry Pi, step by step. Many LCD
   touchscreens for the Raspberry Pi include an image file that you
   can write to your SD card and get up and running pretty
   quickly. But what if you want to run a clean version of Raspbian,
   without all the bloatware included on the manufacturer's image?
   Also, what if you want to install a different OS such as Rasbmc or
   XBMC? In these cases, you should follow this tutorial and go
   through the steps to configure it on your own. This works on the
   Raspberry Pi 2 Model B as well as older versions of the Raspberry
   Pi. Don't worry, it's not that hard!

   I am using the Waveshare 3.2" TFT (thin-film transistor) LCD. Many
   other LCD screens are supported by this process, but check here to
   see if your screen is supported by the FBTFT driver to make
   sure. Scroll down the file and look for an abbreviated name of the
   screen you are using:

** http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/123038/what-is-the-difference-between-tft-lcd-interfaces

   I am looking at driving a small TFT and have found that the driver
   chip supports various interface methods, however I can't see why I
   would choose one over another.

   The options are:

   - i80
   - SPI
   - VSYNC
   - RGB

   Can anyone describe the pros and cons of the different interfaces?

   In my specific case I want to drive an ILI9320 with a PIC32 via the
   Parallel Master Port.

   ----

   The "i80" parallel interface is simple and fast, and can be driven
   by external memory interfaces on some microcontrollers. However,
   it's a wide parallel bus, and requires a lot of pins to drive.

   SPI requires very few pins to drive, and is available as a hardware
   peripheral on many microcontrollers. It's slower than the parallel
   interface, though.

   The VSYNC and RGB interfaces are mainly useful for displaying
   streaming video from live sources (e.g, in a camera). They aren't
   useful outside special situations.

   Given that you're using a PIC32 with what sounds like a big
   parallel port, the i80 interface is probably ideal.

   With LCD display, touch, IO extension, RTC in one; uses IPS LCD
   180' screen; hight brightness, contrast, bright color; 8, 16 digit
   I80 parallel port; the SPI-I80 parallel port adapter can reach 120m
   max.; the touch part uses TI TSC2003 chip which is I2C 4-cord
   resistance controller and is with 2-CH BAT, AIN to monitor 2-CH
   voltage and 2-CH signals; the IO uses NS LP3943 which is I2C 16-CH
   IO extension and with PWM to drive LED User Manual:
